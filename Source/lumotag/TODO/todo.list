fix get latest time for analysis - looks broken

try new RingBufferCamera camera class made by opus, do not lose the chat!!

3D:::modify close-range camera mount. reduce z, add posts so don't need to use the spacers?
3D:::have a look at the M12 converter - can we add a small angle there for the sensor? or can we even hold it in more firmly as right now it just flops about and is subject to glue accuracy


fix failure to analyse completely obvious tags again using new M12 lense :(

you have two different tags on the headband!!!

get COLOUR image when pulling trigger and you have a player targetted - save these images to harddrive
its ok to lag here because we show white on the screen for the gun fire
that means we can get a much nicer killscreen

how do we handle AMMO - its still client side

Fix current broken shell start-up script - waiting for internet

make github repo private

LONGERTERM:

mouse for touch control

custom insults in payload
look for IR flash instead of flashlight


WIRING:
new capacitor - doesnt seem to do much
