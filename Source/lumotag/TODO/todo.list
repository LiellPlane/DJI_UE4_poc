its ok to lag here because we show white on the screen for the gun fire
that means we can get a much nicer killscreen

need to add targetted user stats

how do we handle AMMO - its still client side

Fix current broken shell start-up script - waiting for internet

make github repo private

LONGERTERM:

mouse for touch control

custom insults in payload
look for IR flash instead of flashlight


WIRING:
new capacitor - doesnt seem to do much
