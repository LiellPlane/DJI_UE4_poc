fix get latest time for analysis - looks broken

fix failure to analyse completely obvious tags again using new M12 lense :(

you have two different tags on the headband!!!

get COLOUR image when pulling trigger and you have a player targetted - save these images to harddrive
its ok to lag here because we show white on the screen for the gun fire
that means we can get a much nicer killscreen

how do we handle AMMO - its still client side

Fix current broken shell start-up script - waiting for internet

make github repo private

LONGERTERM:

mouse for touch control

custom insults in payload
look for IR flash instead of flashlight


WIRING:
new capacitor - doesnt seem to do much
