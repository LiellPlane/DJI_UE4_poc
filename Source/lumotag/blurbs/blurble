LUMOTAG is a fusion of video game first-person shooters like Fortnite and arena-combat games such as laser tag.  Players each have a blaster and wear ID tags for the blaster cameras to detect. A small server is also running to maintain the game state.

The blaster itself has an integrated HUD, annotating the image feed with game stats such as hitpoints, name and avatar of any player in the crosshairs and also relays key game moments, relaying a 3rd-person view when you're eliminated from play, and at night transitions to become your primary combat interface - as is infra-red sensitive, enabling stealth scenarios. The prototype has been designed from the ground up with optical performance as the top priority, addressing common issues faced by other camera-based entertainment - such as poor low-light response, motion blur, and limited visual range.

The system is designed to appeal to those already engaged in group activities like axe-throwing, laser tag, combat archery, and go-karting, with kits to be available for sale or rental to commercial venues. The game style and platform integrates naturally with a league structure similar to online games like Fortnite, where users maintain a persistent profile loaded at each visit and can build their rating.
