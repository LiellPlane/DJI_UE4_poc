    - Keep a bounded cache of most recent frames (raw grayscale)
    - Encode and POST only on explicit request
    - Ignore network failures, crash on malformed requests

class WebSocketEventsComms(AbstractEventsComms):
    """Ultra-lightweight, threaded sender and receiver for small events.

    Design goals:
    - Send small event objects (PlayerStatus, GameStatus, PlayerTagged)
    - Receive and queue incoming events mapped to lumotag_events types
    - Avoid extra processes; use a single background thread
    - No busy waiting; block on a single control queue
    - Ignore network failures, crash on malformed events
    - Auto-reconnection like WebSocketImageComms
    - Crash on queue overflow or parsing errors (don't hide errors)
    - Rate-limited logging to prevent stdout flooding

    Public API:
      - send_event(event)
      - get_received_event() -> event or None
      - get_received_events_count() -> int
      - is_connected()
      - get_send_queue_size()
      - raise_thread_error_if_any()
    
    Example:
        # Production use (quiet, minimal output):
        comms = WebSocketEventsComms("ws://server:8080", "device_01")
        
        # Development/debugging (verbose output):
